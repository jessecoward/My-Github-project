Front-end frame :ReactJS  Backend framework :Node.js + ExpressJS  Database :MongoDB  Authentication :JSON Web tokenst (JWT) Cloud platform :AWS   Proposal:  We plan to build an online store based on full stack technology. The platform will allow users to browse and buy products and interact with customer service teams when needed. We will use the following techniques and frameworks:  Front-end frame :ReactJS  React is a popular open source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We will use React to build a modern single-page application (spaa) that will provide an efficient user experience while supporting asynchronous loading and complex data structures.   Backend framework :Node.js + ExpressJS  Node.js is a popular open source JavaScript runtime environment that can be used to build high-performance back-end services. We will use Node.js and ExpressJS frameworks to process Web requests and connect them to the MongoDB database.   Database :MongoDB  MongoDB is an open source, cross-platform document database for storing semi-structured data. We will use MongoDB to store product information, order, user information, etc.   Authentication :JSON Web tokenst (JWT) JSON Web Tokens is an open standard (RFC 7519) for safely transferring declarations between Web applications. We will use JWT to authenticate users and provide security and scalability.   Cloud platform :AWS  We will use amazon Web services (AWS) to host our applications. AWS provides tools and services to automate the construction, deployment, and monitoring of applications that reduce management costs and improve application reliability and performance.   In general, our goal is to create a high-performance, extensible, secure online store that takes advantage of the full stack technology. This will bring better user experience and business value to our customers.  Create the Gatsby application: First, you need to install Node.js and Gatsby CLI, and then use the Gatsby CLI command to create a new Gatsby application. You can choose to use the ready-made template provided by Gatsby or customize the configuration according to your own needs. Once created, you can start the application locally and test it.  Integrated Express framework: Once you create the Gatsby application, you can use the Express framework to implement the back end. You need to install the Express framework in your application and write Express routing to handle requests from the client. You can use the REST API design principles to define routing and use middleware to implement various functions, such as authentication and request validation. Using the Express framework also makes it easy for you to integrate with other third-party services and apis.   Use MongoDB database: When implementing the back end, you need a database to store and retrieve data. MongoDB is a popular document database that integrates well with the Node.js and Express frameworks. You can connect and manipulate databases in your application using MongoDB official Node.js driver or other third-party libraries, such as mongoose.   Authentication: Authentication is a key part of protecting application security. You can use JSON Web tokensk (JWT) to achieve token authentication. This requires creating JWT when the user logs in and storing it in the client Cookie or LocalStorage. Then, each request, the client needs to include JWT in the request header for the server to verify the user identity.   Deploy on the cloud: Once you have completed the development and testing of the application, you need to deploy it on the cloud. AWS is a popular cloud platform that provides a variety of tools and services for automated application construction, deployment, and management. You can use the AWS Elastic Beanstalk service to automatically deploy and extend applications, use the AWS Lambda function to handle server-free architectures, use AWS S3 storage services to store static files, and so on.  In general, these steps require some technical knowledge and experience, but if you follow the right steps, you should be able to create a high-performance, extensible, secure full-stack application and deploy it on the cloud for users to use.  Build a Web based add, delete, and review table that allows users to add, edit, delete, and view data.  The user enters data on the front page and clicks the submit button.  The front-end code sends the request to the back-end API endpoint.  The back-end code forwards the request to the database and inserts the data into the "items" collection.  The back end returns the response to the front end to display a successful or failed message.  Users can view, edit, or delete data on the front page. The front end sends the corresponding request to the back end API endpoint.  The back-end code forwards the request to the database and performs the action (such as updating or deleting data).  The back end returns the response to the front end to display a successful or failed message.  In summary, by building a list application that adds, removes, and relooks, you can show how to build a complete Web application using full-stack technology and can involve multiple aspects such as front end, back end, and database.
